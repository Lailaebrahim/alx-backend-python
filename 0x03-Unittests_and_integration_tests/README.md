## The Difference Between Unit and Integration Tests

Unit tests and integration tests are two different types of tests that serve different purposes in software development.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual units of code in isolation. A unit can be a function, a method, or a class. The goal of unit testing is to verify that each unit of code behaves as expected and produces the correct output given a specific input. 

### Integration Tests

Integration tests, on the other hand, focus on testing the interaction between different units of code. They ensure that the different components of a system work together correctly.

### Common Testing Patterns

In addition to unit and integration tests, there are several common testing patterns that can be used to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of testing:

- **Mocking**: Mocking involves creating fake objects or functions to simulate the behavior of dependencies. This allows you to isolate the unit under test and test it in isolation.

- **Parametrizations**: Parametrizations allow you to run the same test with different sets of input data. This helps to increase test coverage and identify edge cases.

- **Fixtures**: Fixtures are reusable objects or functions that provide a known and consistent state for tests. They help to reduce code duplication and make tests more maintainable.
